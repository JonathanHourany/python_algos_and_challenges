The look-and-say problem asks to solve the following challenge:
* Given a starting sequence of 1, generate a new sequence by reading off the digits of the previous sequence, counting the number of digits in groups of the same digit, and doing this N times.

Example output of N = 6 would be
('1', '11', '21', '1211', '111221', '312211)

Because, for sequence 2, the previous entry has "one, one", and for the 3 sequence, the previous had "two ones". Get it?
